## üêõ Known Issues & Fixes

### OAuth2 Authentication Error

**Issue**: Users may encounter this error when trying to authenticate:
```
Access blocked: InboxWhiz's request is invalid
Error 400: invalid_request
Custom URI scheme is not supported on Chrome apps.
```

**Root Cause**: The OAuth2 client in Google Cloud Console is configured as a "Web application" instead of a "Chrome extension".

**Fix Required**: The OAuth2 client configuration needs to be updated in Google Cloud Console:
1. Navigate to APIs & Services > Credentials
2. Edit the OAuth2 client ID: `396720193118-fggljh2amq0jlgq4v861vqn6rb88q9dt`
3. Change Application type to "Chrome extension"
4. Set Application ID to: `bjcegpgebdbhkkhngbahpfjfolcmkpma`

See `OAUTH_FIX.md` for detailed instructions.
